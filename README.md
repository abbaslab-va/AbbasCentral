# Welcome to AbbasCentral!
This is the Github repository for the Abbas Lab's framework for behavioral, neural, and video data processing.
The classes and functions are designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing the user to customize the inputs according to their specific needs. 
It contains functions for analyzing performance and positional data during behavior in freely moving mice, as well as processing and analyzing synchronous neural recordings. 

## Code standards

Below you can find guidelines to adhere to when writing new methods or changing existing ones that, when followed, will help to keep this codebase as readable and consistent as possible.

### Class interfaces
* All methods should have a function header in the class interface. Methods should be defined in separate files
* Maintain single line spacing between methods and keep them organized by function
* "Friend" functions like plots can be kept in the class interface, commented out

### Naming
* Variables should be named in camel case (i.e. myVariable)
* Functions should be all lower case with underscores (i.e. my_function())
* Classes should use pascal case (i.e. MyClass)

### Documentation
* All functions should have a function header with a description of the function, inputs, and outputs
* All new methods should be updated in this readme file to match their function headers
* Comments should be used to explain the reasoning behind any non-obvious code

## Data organization
This software package makes several fundamental assumptions about your data organization that must be followed if you want full functionality:

1) Data is organized heirarchically, with a single parent directory housing folders for each animal recorded during an experiment, each containing subfolders that house all of the data from individual experiments.

2) A file called "config.ini" must be present in the root directory of your data folder that you select when you call the function select_experiment. This file is used to indicate the relationship between the timestamp recieved by your acquisition system and the experimental time points they are marking. 

3) The experiment is trialized, with a trial start timestamp sent by the Bpod system at the beginning of each trial. This timestamp should be called "Trial Start" in the config.ini file (no quotes - see example below).

### config.ini   
An example layout for this file is shown below:

```
[info]
Experimenter = Your name here
StartState = Name of the bpod state that sends the Trial Start Timestamp


[timestamps]
Off = 65528
Trial Start = 65529
Laser On = 65530
Forage = 65531
Reward = 65532
Punish = 65533

[regions]
PFC = [1:25, 27, 29, 31]
NACC = 26
MD = 28
VTA = 30
VHIP = 32

[trialTypes]
Left = 1
Right = 2

[outcomes]
Correct = 1
Incorrect = 0
```

* The above [timestamps] section contains key-value pairs, giving names to the numbered timestamps that can be used for indexing functions such as trialize_spikes. An example call:
    
    `trializedSpikes = trialize_spikes('Trial Start')`

* The [regions] section indicates the relationship between electrode channels and implanted regions, which can be used to examine neurons from a certain region or specific relationships between one or more regions. 
* [trialTypes] is used to indicate the type of trial you wish to investigate. The name assigned to a trial type or a collection of trial types is arbitrary and is to assist the researcher in making explicit their desired subset of data. This is extracted from the Bpod session file, in the 'TrialTypes' field.
* [outcomes] details the meaning of the trial outcomes saved to the Bpod session file in the field 'SessionPerformance'. Again, these serve as a way to allow the researcher to subdivide the data using explicit and obvious mapping to english "macros".

# BehDat Class

This class is intended to abstract behavioral sessions and their accompanying data into a class object that can call functions to quickly and cleanly manipulate and visualize the underlying data. Since objects of this class represent a single session, collections of sessions must have an external associated experimental metadata variable. This variable and the array of session objects that it helps manage are both generated by the function 

`[sessions, metadata] = select_experiment;`

which brings up an interactive directory selection menu. If your data is properly organized according to the above specifications, this function will initialize an array of BehDat objects that is equal in length to the total number of subfolders across all subjects in the parent directory.

## Experiment metadata

This is a structure that accompanies the BehDat object array generated from select_experiment. It contains fields:

    subjects - a 1xS cell array with names of each of the S subjects in the experiment
    path - a string to the local directory that houses the experimental data
    experimenter - The name of the experimenter (set up in config file)

## BehDat Properties

    info - a structure containing subfields:
        > path - Path to the experimental session data
        > name - The subject's name. Will match one of the subjects in metadata.subjects
        > baud - Sampling rate of the neural aquisition hardware
        > samples - Number of samples captured in the neural session
        > trialTypes - structure containing key-value pairs from config.ini
        > outcomes - structure containing key-value pairs from config.ini
        > startState - the name of the bpod state where the trial start timestamp is sent
    spikes - a structure containing subfields:
        > times - a 1xN cell array of spike times, where N is the number of neurons
        > region - 1xN cell array of brain regions of the single units
        > channel - 1xN double list of original channels on acquisition hardwarea
        > fr - average firing rate over the whole session
        > waveforms - a 1xN cell array of average waveform shapes
        > halfValleyWidth - waveform width at half of max depolarization
        > halfPeakWidth - waveform width at half of max hyperpolarization
        > peak2valley - difference in amplitude from peak to valley
        > exciteOutput - generated from find_mono. Indices of neurons monosynaptically downstream from the given neuron.
        > exciteXcorr - 50 ms wide cross correlogram between the two neurons across the whole session.
        > exciteWeight - strength of the correlation in terms of standard deviations of the peak above baseline.
    timestamps - a structure containing subfields:
        > times - a 1xT double array of timestamp times, where T is the number of timestamps
        > codes - a 1xT double array of timestamp codes (i.e. 65529)
        > keys - a structure containing key strings that can be used by the user to reference specific timestamp codes. Set up in config.ini file
        > trialStart - a 1xT vector of timestamps denoting the start of trials. Generated during populate_BehDat
    bpod - a SessionData file from a Bpod session
    coordinates - x and y coordinates from DeepLabCut, imported from csv

## BehDat Methods

# ExpManager Class

The ExpManager class' responsibility is to call the BehDat functions on specific collections of sessions from an experiment and return aggregated results that can be used for population-based statistical analyses. 

# Example workflow
The following example demonstrates how a researcher may use this package to set up a data pipeline, from collection and spike sorting, to synchronization with parallel data streams, to data analysis, visualization and storage. 

## A) Organize project directory

Collect all files related to individual behavioral sessions in separate directories. Each folder should contain at minimum:
    
* NS6 and NEV file
* Bpod SessionData

    Additionally, directories can contain the following:
* CSV from deeplabcut data (see deeplabcut section for that workflow)


## B) Sort spikes with kilosort

## C) Run deeplabcut on video files 

## D) Select experiment
