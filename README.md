# Welcome to AbbasCentral!
This is the Github repository for the Abbas Lab's framework for behavioral, neural, and video data processing.
The classes and functions are designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing the user to customize the inputs according to their specific needs. 
It contains functions for analyzing performance and positional data during behavior in freely moving mice, as well as processing and analyzing synchronous neural recordings. 

This software package makes several fundamental assumptions about your data organization that must be followed if you want full functionality:

1) Data is organized heirarchically, with a single parent directory housing folders for each animal recorded during an experiment, each containing subfolders that house all of the data from individual experiments.

2) A file called "config.ini" must be present in the root directory of your data folder that you select when you call the function select_experiment. This file is used to indicate the relationship between the timestamp recieved by your acquisition system and the experimental time points they are marking. An example layout for this file is shown below:

```
[experimenter]
'Experimenter' = 'Your name here'

[timestamps]
'Off' = 65528
'Trial Start' = 65529
'Laser On' = 65530
'Forage' = 65531
'Reward' = 65532
'Punish' = 65533

[regions]
'PFC' = [1:25, 27, 29, 31]
'NACC' = 26
'MD' = 28
'VTA' = 30
'VHIP' = 32

[trialTypes]
'Left' = 1
'Right' = 2

[outcomes]
'Correct' = 1
'Incorrect' = 0
```

 ## config.ini   
* The above [timestamps] section contains key-value pairs, giving names to the numbered timestamps that can be used for indexing functions such as trialize_spikes. It must include a timestamps section and a timestamp with the key 'Trial Start' in order to trialize spikes. An example call:
    
    `trializedSpikes = trialize_spikes('Laser On', 2)`

* The [regions] section indicates the relationship between electrode channels and implanted regions, which can be used to examine neurons from a certain region or specific relationships between one or more regions. 
* [trialTypes] is used to indicate the type of trial you wish to investigate. The name assigned to a trial type or a collection of trial types is arbitrary and is to assist the researcher in making explicit their desired subset of data. This is extracted from the Bpod session file, in the 'TrialTypes' field.
* [outcomes] details the meaning of the trial outcomes saved to the Bpod session file in the field 'SessionPerformance'. Again, these serve as a way to allow the researcher to subdivide the data using explicit and obvious mapping to english "macros".

# BehDat Class

This class is intended to abstract behavioral sessions and their accompanying data into a class object that can call functions to quickly and cleanly manipulate and visualize the underlying data. Since objects of this class represent a single session, collections of sessions must have an external associated experimental metadata variable. This variable and the array of session objects that it helps manage are both generated by the function 

`[sessions, metadata] = select_experiment;`

which brings up an interactive directory selection menu. If your data is properly organized according to the above specifications, this function will initialize an array of BehDat objects that is equal in length to the total number of subfolders across all subjects in the parent directory.

## Experiment metadata

This is a structure that accompanies the BehDat object array generated from select_experiment. It contains fields:

    subjects - a 1xS cell array with names of each of the S subjects in the experiment
    path - a string to the local directory that houses the experimental data
    experimenter - The name of the experimenter (set up in config file)

## BehDat Properties

    info - a structure containing subfields:
        > name - The subject's name. Will match one of the subjects in metadata.subjects
        > baud - Sampling rate of the neural aquisition hardware
        > samples - Number of samples captured in the neural session
    spikes - a structure containing subfields:
        > times - a 1xN cell array of spike times, where N is the number of neurons
        > region - 1xN cell array of brain regions of the single units
        > channel - 1xN double list of original channels on acquisition hardware
    lfp - 
    waveforms - a 1xN cell array of average waveform shapes
    timestamps - a structure containing subfields:
        > times - a 1xT double array of timestamp times, where T is the number of timestamps
        > codes - a 1xT double array of timestamp codes (i.e. 65529)
        > keys - a structure containing key strings that can be used by the user to reference specific timestamp codes. Set up in config.ini file
    bpod - a SessionData file from a Bpod session
    coordinates - x and y coordinates from DeepLabCut, imported from csv

## BehDat Methods

Methods for the BehDat class can be thought of as generally belonging to one of 4 categories: Bpod, Spike, LFP, and Video. Functions relating to bpod, spikes, and video can be run simultaneously on arrays of objects, as the overhead for storing the associated data is relatively low. Functions that require LFP analysis should be run on one subject at a time, as the cost to memory for storing raw ephys data is prohibitively large. These functions will load the LFP, manipulate and analyze the signal as needed, save the results, and delete the LFP from the workspace.

### Bpod

### Spikes
### LFP
### Video

# Example workflow
The following example demonstrates how a researcher may use this package to set up a data pipeline, from collection and spike sorting, to synchronization with parallel data streams, to data analysis, visualization and storage. 
## A) Organize project directory
## B) Sort spikes with kilosort
## C) Select experiment
