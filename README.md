# Welcome to AbbasCentral!
This is the github repository for the Abbas Lab's framework for behavioral, neural, and video data processing.
The classes and functions are designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing the user to customize the inputs according to their specific needs. 
It contains functions for analyzing performance and positional data during behavior in freely moving mice, as well as processing and analyzing synchronous neural recordings. 

This software package makes several fundamental assumptions about your data organization that must be followed if you want full functionality:

* Data is organized heirarchically, with a single parent directory housing folders for each animal recorded during an experiment, each containing subfolders that house all of the data from individual experiments.

* A file called "config.ini" must be present in the root directory of your data folder that you select when you call the function select_experiment. This file can be blank, but it is used to indicate the relationship between the timestamp recieved by your acquisition system and the experimental time points they are marking. An example layout for this file is shown below:

```
[timestamps]
'Off' = 65528
'Trial Start' = 65529
'Laser On' = 65530
'Forage' = 65531
'Reward' = 65532
'Punish' = 65533
[experimenter]
'Experimenter' = 'Your name here'
```

* The above [timestamps] section contains key-value pairs, giving names to the numbered timestamps that can be used for indexing functions such as trialize_spikes. An example call:
    
    `trializedSpikes = trialize_spikes('Laser On', 2)`

# BehDat Class

This class is intended to abstract behavioral sessions and their accompanying data into a class object that can call functions to quickly and cleanly manipulate and visualize the underlying data. Since objects of this class represent a single session, collections of sessions must have an external associated experimental metadata variable. This variable and the array of session objects that it helps manage are both generated by the function 

`[sessions, metadata] = select_experiment`

which brings up an interactive directory selection menu. If your data is properly organized according to the above specifications, this function will initialize an array of BehDat objects that is equal in length to the total number of subfolders across all subjects in the parent directory.

## Experiment metadata

This is a structure that accompanies the BehDat object array generated from select_experiment. It contains fields:
    subjects - a 1xS cell array with names of each of the S subjects in the experiment
    path - a string to the local directory that houses the experimental data
    experimenter - The name of the experimenter (set up in config file)

## BehDat Properties

    name - The subject's name. Will match one of the subjects in metadata.subjects
    baud - Sampling rate of the neural aquisition hardware
    frames - Number of samples captured in the neural session
    spikes - a structure containing subfields:
        > times - a 1xN cell array of spike times, where N is the number of neurons
        > regions - 1xN cell array of brain regions of the single units
        > channels - 1xN double list of original channels on acquisition hardware
    lfp - 
    waveforms - a 1xN cell array of average waveform shapes
    timestamps - a structure containing subfields:
        > times - a 1xT double array of timestamp times, where T is the number of timestamps
        > codes - a 1xT double array of timestamp codes (i.e. 65529)
        > keys - a structure containing key strings that can be used by the user to reference specific timestamp codes. Set up in config.ini file
    bpod - a SessionData file from a Bpod session
