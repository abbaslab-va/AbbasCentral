# Welcome to AbbasCentral!
This repository hosts the Abbas Lab's framework for behavioral, neural, and video data processing.
The classes and corresponding methods are designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing the user to customize the data structures and inputs according to their specific needs. 
It contains functions for analyzing performance and positional data during behavior in freely moving mice, as well as processing and analyzing synchronous neural recordings.
