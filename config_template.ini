% This is a template file for the configuration file that must be present in the root 
% folder of each experiment that you will collect into the same ExpManager object.
% This means it will share a directory with the folders that contain data from each animal.
% When copying this template into your directory for your own use, please rename the file
% as 'config.ini'. Fill in each field with the appropriate pairs for your experiment. You 
% may leave any fields blank as appropriate for your individual experiment. There must, however,
% be values for the StartState (the bpod state that sends the trial start wire signal) as well as 
% a timestamp for the trial start field (65529 is the default for wire 1 with the cereplex in its current configuration).

% In case your experiment contains sessions with different experimental conditions

% of how to fill this field out - in this case, BehDat_name will be what you use to refer
% to the sessions when using the ExpManager class, and file_suffix is the naming convention
% used in the individual session folders
